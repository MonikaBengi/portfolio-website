# Monika Bengi — Portfolio Website 🌸  

A clean, elegant personal portfolio, designed and built in my own style.  
Background video, auto-rotating slideshow, GitHub & LinkedIn sections, and a popup contact form. ✨  

**Live demo:** https://monikabengi.github.io/portfolio-website/

## Features
- Sticky navigation with section links (Home, Slideshow, About, GitHub, LinkedIn, Contact)  
- Background video with soft overlay  
- Automatic slideshow with manual controls and dot navigation  
- Popup contact form via Formspree  
- Responsive layout with pastel tones and balanced typography

## Tech Stack
HTML • CSS • JavaScript • GitHub Pages  

This project was part of my Web Development training at Pitman Training, in collaboration with Tech Academy.  
The base structure was provided during the course; I customized, styled, and extended it to fit my own approach.

## How It’s Built
- **Navbar:** fixed at the top, animated fade-in with keyframes  
- **Hero video:** full-width background, hidden on small screens for performance  
- **Slideshow:** `.mySlides.fade` with arrows and dots; `showSlides()`, `plusSlides()`, `currentSlide()` and auto-rotate with hover pause and tab visibility handling  
- **Contact form:** modal toggled by `openForm()` / `closeForm()`, closes on outside click  
- **Typography:** viewport-based scaling and multiple breakpoints

## Design Highlights
- Colors: `#fff7f4`, `#f4c2c2`, `#b89663`, `#b97985`, `#2b2b2b`  
- All images have `alt` text; external links open in new tabs  
- Mobile video disabled for smoother experience
